    	<b> HPLC: </b> 
    	<br/>
 	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

		High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) is a separation method that can be used to separate 
		
		oligonucleotides by their sequence and is sensitive enough to give single nucleotide resolution. In other 
		
		words, HPLC can differentiate between two nearly identical oligonucleotide sequences. This property 
		
		makes for a very useful analytical method for characterizing the products from the degradation of a 
		
		longer oligonucleotide into smaller chains.
		
	<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
	<b>MALDI-TOF: </b>
	<br/>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		
		Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time Of Flight (MALDI-TOF) is a mass spectrometry 
		
		technique that has been used extensively for the analysis of biomolecules, and has been employed 
		
		as a valuable means for determining DNA sequence. We used this as a means for determining the 
		
		sequences of the degradation products. This information, in turn, tells us which linkages along the 
		
		chain are most prone to degradation, allowing for the potential of engineering a new sequence that will 
		
		degrade into predetermined products.
	
	<br/><br/> <br/> <br/>
	<b>Nanodrop - Spectrophotometer: </b>
	<br/>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	
		Uses the degree to which a substance absorbs a certain wavelength of light to provide fast and reliable 
		
		measurement of the concentration of a given substance. This was an invaluable technique for ensuring 
		
		that our oligonucleotide solutions were all at the same concentration.
		
	<br/><br/> <br/> <br/>
	<b>Block Incubator: </b>
	<br/>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		This was one of the two methods used to incubate the experimental samples. Incubation in this
		
		manner allows the samples to be monitored more easily whilst incubating each sample tube 
		
		individually.
	
	<br/><br/> <br/> <br/>
	<b>Convection Oven: </b>
	<br/>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		The second method used for sample incubation, was kept at an identical temperature to the block 
		
		incubator. It differs in fuctionality from the block incubator by changing the evaporation of the oligonucleotide buffer 
		
		(Deionized Water) so that it does not condense at the top of the tube. Instead it's maintained primarily 
		
		in a vapor phase. Additionally, the oven was used to dry samples that were deposited on either a glass 
		
		or polypropylene surface.
		
	<br/><br/> <br/> <br/>
	<b>Vacufuge: </b>
	<br/>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		A dehydration method similar to lyophilization. It increases the temperature of the environment 
		
		in order to speed up evaporation processes. This machine was used to dry some of our experimental 
		
		samples prior to incubation.
	<br/><br/> <br/> <br/>
	<b>Nap-5 Purification: </b>
	<br/>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		This is a separation column that is a simple and easy-to-use method for swapping buffers for oligonucleotides 
		
		via gravity flow. For this investigation, Nap-5 columns were used to exchange buffers after HPLC 
		
		purification so that the samples could be later analyzed with MALDI-TOF.
